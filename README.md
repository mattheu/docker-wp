Docker WordPress
================

A really basic WP docker environment. Basically it is just Nginx, PHP, MySQL with a few WP things such as WP-CLI.

It mounts the `www` directory so just clone your project or install WP in this directory.

## TODO

- WP-CLI
- map domains
- memcache
- PHPUnit.
- Easy importing dbs.
- xdebug
